## Installation

```bash

## Usage

### Running a Pebble program

```bash
pebble examples/hello.pb
```

### Example Pebble program (`hello.pb`)

```pebble
say "Hello Pebble!"

x is 2 ^ 3
say x
! Output: 8

nums is {1, 2, 3}
say len(nums)
! Output: 3

fnc greet(name):
    say "Hello " + name

greet("Rasa")
```

---

## Loops and Conditions

```pebble
nums is {0, 1, 2}
go i in nums:
    say "Hello"

x is 10
if x big 5:
    say "x is bigger than 5"
```

---

## Collections

```pebble
numbers is {10, 20, 30}
say numbers

person is [name: "Rasa", age: 14]
say person

go n in numbers:
    say n * 2

say person["name"]
say person["age"]
```

This will output:

```
[10, 20, 30]
{'name': 'Rasa', 'age': 14}
20
40
60
Rasa
14
```
